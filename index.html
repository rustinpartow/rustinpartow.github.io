		How do workers initially match with firms, and how do these matches improve over time? An influential perspective is known as the job ladder. In the job ladder, poached workers tend to move to better firms, while workers who are displaced into unemployment by shocks tend to reemploy into worse firms. I present theory and evidence in favor of an alternative ``inverted job ladder" to describe reallocation in the skilled professions. Using a historical data set on lawyers, I show that lawyers switching from surviving firms move to worse firms, while lawyers who are displaced because their law firm dissolved reemploy at better firms. I then present a model that explains how these inverted job ladder patterns will tend to arise in labor markets where (1) firms are specialized in heterogeneous levels of talent, and (2) firms privately learn their workers' talents after hiring them. These two features are consistent with empirical patterns in my data, seem common-place to most skilled professions, and differ from the standard job ladder literature. In the model, private-learning creates a lemons problem where job-switching workers are adversely selected. Firms who are willing to poach lemons from their rivals tend to be lower in the ladder, and thus more specialized in lemons. The model's incorporation of rich firm heterogeneity and tractable, infinite-horizon Markov dynamics allow it to more realistically portray market efficiency compared to the previous generation of private learning models. I structurally estimate the model in order to quantify misallocation due to private learning.

		    <p align="justify"> 	We add collusive capacity to the theory of collusion in dynamic oligopolies. In our model, firms accumulate just enough capacity to inflict standard Nash-reversion punishments. This voluntary restriction in capacity is both easily enforced, and significantly reduces incentives for individual firms to deviate from a collusive regime. As the number of firms goes to infinity, the critical discount factor required to sustain collusion converges to a number that is strictly below 1. Thus, our model challenges the standard intuition that collusion becomes harder as the number of firms increases.

					<p align="justify"> Should government wages be marked to market indices? If so, which indices--occupational or spatial ones? We present new evidence on this important
						policy question using administrative payroll data from the	US federal government. In order to study how different pay indexation policies influence retention, we estimate a structural model of employee quit behavior. To estimate the model,
						we exploit variation in pay caused by a pay-indexation policy known as the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1991 (FEPCA). Our identification strategy exploits a unique, Bartik-like feature of FEPCA's implementation. FEPCA measured inside-outside pay disparties for a rich set of employee groups, but chose to base subsequent
						pay supplements on the average pay gap in each of 32 localities. Thus, employees' "treatment" was largely determined by the plausibly exogenous composition of nearby federal workers.

		 <!-- Partow (2019) predicts that introducing exogenous sources of public information about workers' talents into the labor market will increase average earnings as well as earnings inequality. To test this hypothesis, I use the phased rollout of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams across different states as a quasi-experimental increase in public information. I compare the within-state earnings distributions of accountants on the basis of whether or not their state had a CPA exam, as well as the informativeness of their state's exam (based on passage rates). -->


	<!--The largest 100 law firms differ widely along many important margins: profitability, hours, prestige, work-life balance, promotion probabilities, exit options, amenities, pension benefits, pro-bono opportunities, and more. It is therefore puzzling that, for about half a century, these firms have typically offered the exact same wages to first-year associates. A popular explanation for this phenomenon is that, by appealing to industry norms rather than economic calculations when determining wages, firms can cultivate a greater sense of professionalism and dignity. However, this explanation seems inconsistent with episodic industry-wide increases in first-year pay, which clearly are economic. In this project, I use data on the top 100 law firms to evaluate two competing economic explanations for matching on first-year pay. The first explanation posits that firms are engaged in tacit collusion on wages, supported by the threat of a "salary war," resulting in below-competitive wages. The second explanation posits that firms are engaged in a game of incomplete information, where they use first-year wages in order to credibly signal their financial health to prospective employees, generating wages that are higher than the competitive full-information setting. -->



<!-- Progressive income taxation creates a more equitable distribution of resources at the possible expense of distorting the incentives to work. However, progressive income taxation also penalizes the choice of careers with high state-dependent or intertemporal variability in earnings. This under-appreciated distortion is a simple consequence of Jensen's inequality: any tax schedule where after-tax earnings are concave in pre-tax earnings will penalize pre-tax income variability. In this project, I combine cross-country data on income taxation and longitudinal earnings in order to simulate after-tax earnings and quantify the occupations for which the income variability penalty has typically been largest. To check whether the income variability penalty actually distorts economic decisions, I perform a cross-country case study of farmers, who have occasionally received special "income-averaging" tax provisions designed to mitigate the income variability penalty. I test whether the introduction or repeal of these provisions was associated with greater or reduced preference for planting risky crops.  -->
