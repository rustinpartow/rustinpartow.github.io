How do workers initially match with firms, and how do these matches improve over time? A large job ladder literature devoted to this question proposes a unanimous surplus-ranking of firms in which poached workers move to better firms while displaced workers move to worse firms. Using a new historical dataset on lawyers, I rank law firms based on where their lawyers went to school, finding that poached lawyers move to worse firms while displaced lawyers move to better firms. Guided by these and several other stylized facts, I propose an alternative theory to the standard job ladder approach. In my model, each worker's surplus-maximizing firm assignment is a function of her talent. Incumbent firms privately learn how talented their workers are, and thus only allow adversely selected worker types to be poached. In equilibrium, poached workers move down in rank (to firms where they are more productive). Meanwhile, workers who are retained are revealed over time to have been under-placed, so random displacement shocks move them up in rank (to firms where they are more productive) by temporarily removing the adverse selection problem. The model is well-suited for quantifying the value of labor market institutions that publicly certify talent. By estimating the model, I find that more than 20% of output is lost to misallocation induced by informational frictions. Pre-job market screening devices can substantially raise average earnings, creating a rationale to regulate the timing of job recruitment to prevent it from disrupting informative competition in academics.

It is widely believed that cartels with too many members are destined to fail. The
standard argument is that as the number of cartel members increases, shares of collusive profit diminish relative to deviation profits.
We show that this argument is built on unreasonable assumptions about plant capacity. We add plant capacity choices
to an otherwise standard dynamic oligopoly game. We consider the unsophisticated
and easily enforced strategy in which each firm simply chooses plant capacity equal
to static Nash output. Our main result is that as the number of firms goes to infinity,
the critical discount factor required to sustain collusion on the monopoly price converges to less than 0.63.
Thus, collusion is (quite) robust to the number of firms. This result applies to a broad
class of demand functions and to both Cournot and Bertrand competition.

					<p align="justify"> Should government wages be marked to market indices? If so, which indices--occupational or spatial ones? We present new evidence on this important
						policy question using administrative payroll data from the	US federal government. In order to study how different pay indexation policies influence retention, we estimate a structural model of employee quit behavior. To estimate the model,
						we exploit variation in pay caused by a pay-indexation policy known as the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1991 (FEPCA). Our identification strategy exploits a unique, Bartik-like feature of FEPCA's implementation. FEPCA measured inside-outside pay disparties for a rich set of employee groups, but chose to base subsequent
						pay supplements on the average pay gap in each of 32 localities. Thus, employees' "treatment" was largely determined by the plausibly exogenous composition of nearby federal workers.

		 <!-- Partow (2019) predicts that introducing exogenous sources of public information about workers' talents into the labor market will increase average earnings as well as earnings inequality. To test this hypothesis, I use the phased rollout of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams across different states as a quasi-experimental increase in public information. I compare the within-state earnings distributions of accountants on the basis of whether or not their state had a CPA exam, as well as the informativeness of their state's exam (based on passage rates). -->


	<!--The largest 100 law firms differ widely along many important margins: profitability, hours, prestige, work-life balance, promotion probabilities, exit options, amenities, pension benefits, pro-bono opportunities, and more. It is therefore puzzling that, for about half a century, these firms have typically offered the exact same wages to first-year associates. A popular explanation for this phenomenon is that, by appealing to industry norms rather than economic calculations when determining wages, firms can cultivate a greater sense of professionalism and dignity. However, this explanation seems inconsistent with episodic industry-wide increases in first-year pay, which clearly are economic. In this project, I use data on the top 100 law firms to evaluate two competing economic explanations for matching on first-year pay. The first explanation posits that firms are engaged in tacit collusion on wages, supported by the threat of a "salary war," resulting in below-competitive wages. The second explanation posits that firms are engaged in a game of incomplete information, where they use first-year wages in order to credibly signal their financial health to prospective employees, generating wages that are higher than the competitive full-information setting. -->



<!-- Progressive income taxation creates a more equitable distribution of resources at the possible expense of distorting the incentives to work. However, progressive income taxation also penalizes the choice of careers with high state-dependent or intertemporal variability in earnings. This under-appreciated distortion is a simple consequence of Jensen's inequality: any tax schedule where after-tax earnings are concave in pre-tax earnings will penalize pre-tax income variability. In this project, I combine cross-country data on income taxation and longitudinal earnings in order to simulate after-tax earnings and quantify the occupations for which the income variability penalty has typically been largest. To check whether the income variability penalty actually distorts economic decisions, I perform a cross-country case study of farmers, who have occasionally received special "income-averaging" tax provisions designed to mitigate the income variability penalty. I test whether the introduction or repeal of these provisions was associated with greater or reduced preference for planting risky crops.  -->
