		How does the labor market discover talent and reallocate it to its greatest use? 	To shed light on this, I analyze the reallocation of talent using a new historical worker-firm matched data set on US lawyers. I rank firms along a ladder based on size and employee law-school quality, and study how lawyers transition between the ranks. I find that poached workers move down the ranks while workers who are displaced by firm dissolution move up the ranks upon reemployment. These findings are the opposite of what an influential literature on the ``job ladder" has found. I present a new model that explains the inverted job ladder as the consequence of comparative advantage and private employer learning. Firms are ranked by the difficulty of their work, so that high-ranking firms have a comparative advantage in utilizing more talented workers while low-ranking firms have a comparative advantage in utilizing less talented workers. Firms privately observe the talents of their workers, causing poached workers to be negatively selected and displaced workers who have been retained for one or more periods to be positively selected. Thus, comparative advantage favors downward-directed poaching and upward-directed displacement. I validate the model using a standard test for adverse selection among separating employees. Strategic inference from endogenous poaching outcomes is the market's only way to identify talent, suggesting potentially large inefficiencies. To quantify this inefficiency, I estimate the model using my data, solve the equilibrium, and compare net present output to an ideal full-information benchmark. I find that the market is about 90% as efficient as the benchmark, and features very fast inference. If the information structure was changed by converting the endogenous strategic inference process into an exogenous symmetric learning process, and all private information was eliminated, then the market would reach 97% efficiency.

					<p align="justify"> Should government wages be marked to market indices? If so, which indices--occupational or spatial ones? We present new evidence on this important
						policy question using administrative payroll data from the	US federal government. In order to study how different pay indexation policies influence retention, we estimate a structural model of employee quit behavior. To estimate the model,
						we exploit variation in pay caused by a pay-indexation policy known as the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1991 (FEPCA). Our identification strategy exploits a unique, Bartik-like feature of FEPCA's implementation. FEPCA measured inside-outside pay disparties for a rich set of employee groups, but chose to base subsequent
						pay supplements on the average pay gap in each of 32 localities. Thus, employees' "treatment" was largely determined by the plausibly exogenous composition of nearby federal workers.

        <strong> Collusive Capacity, </strong> with <a class="hidelink" href="https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/daehyunkim/"> Daehyun Kim </a> (link coming soon!)
		    <p align="justify"> This paper adds collusive capacity to the classic theory of collusion in dynamic oligopolies to show that collusion with many firms is far easier than previously thought. Similar to most of the literature, we assume that collusive quantities or prices are enforced by the threat of a grim trigger punishment. However, in our model, firms accumulate just enough capacity to inflict this punishment, and no more--a collusive choice that is also enforced within the game. When firms restrict their capacities in this way, the profits of deviating from a collusive regime are greatly reduced, especially as the number of firms grows large. Our main result is an upper bound for the critical (i.e., maximum) discount factor at which monopoly profits can be achieved via collusion, which, uniformly across all possible numbers of firms, is strictly below 1. The collusive capacity levels chosen in our equilibrium are identical to what would be considered competitive capacity levels, which means that they require minimal coordination and should be thought of as a conservative analysis of how the robustness of collusion changes when one seriously considers capacity constraints.

		 <!-- Partow (2019) predicts that introducing exogenous sources of public information about workers' talents into the labor market will increase average earnings as well as earnings inequality. To test this hypothesis, I use the phased rollout of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams across different states as a quasi-experimental increase in public information. I compare the within-state earnings distributions of accountants on the basis of whether or not their state had a CPA exam, as well as the informativeness of their state's exam (based on passage rates). -->


	<!--The largest 100 law firms differ widely along many important margins: profitability, hours, prestige, work-life balance, promotion probabilities, exit options, amenities, pension benefits, pro-bono opportunities, and more. It is therefore puzzling that, for about half a century, these firms have typically offered the exact same wages to first-year associates. A popular explanation for this phenomenon is that, by appealing to industry norms rather than economic calculations when determining wages, firms can cultivate a greater sense of professionalism and dignity. However, this explanation seems inconsistent with episodic industry-wide increases in first-year pay, which clearly are economic. In this project, I use data on the top 100 law firms to evaluate two competing economic explanations for matching on first-year pay. The first explanation posits that firms are engaged in tacit collusion on wages, supported by the threat of a "salary war," resulting in below-competitive wages. The second explanation posits that firms are engaged in a game of incomplete information, where they use first-year wages in order to credibly signal their financial health to prospective employees, generating wages that are higher than the competitive full-information setting. -->



<!-- Progressive income taxation creates a more equitable distribution of resources at the possible expense of distorting the incentives to work. However, progressive income taxation also penalizes the choice of careers with high state-dependent or intertemporal variability in earnings. This under-appreciated distortion is a simple consequence of Jensen's inequality: any tax schedule where after-tax earnings are concave in pre-tax earnings will penalize pre-tax income variability. In this project, I combine cross-country data on income taxation and longitudinal earnings in order to simulate after-tax earnings and quantify the occupations for which the income variability penalty has typically been largest. To check whether the income variability penalty actually distorts economic decisions, I perform a cross-country case study of farmers, who have occasionally received special "income-averaging" tax provisions designed to mitigate the income variability penalty. I test whether the introduction or repeal of these provisions was associated with greater or reduced preference for planting risky crops.  -->
