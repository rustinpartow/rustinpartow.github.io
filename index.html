       <p> I am a doctoral candidate at the UCLA Economics Department. I am a labor economist with an emphasis on dynamic interactions between workers and firms. I am on the market in 2019/20.<p>

              <br>  -->
            
		<p align="justify"> This paper uses novel longitudinal data to show that the careers of US lawyers tend to exhibit mobility down the industry heirarchy. I argue that downward mobility is a symptom of an assymetric information problem
    caused by private employer learning. I present a model of dynamic labor market matching with private learning and two-sided heterogeneity. Private learning creates lopsided mobility, in which low-ranked firms frequently poach lawyers from high-ranked firms, but not vice-versa.
    The reason is that, in the event that a low-ranked firm acquires a star employee, there is no mechanism by which the high-ranked firms can identify her.
    For star employees, the gains of working at high-ranked firms are very large, but the only way to arrive at a high-ranked firm is to start there. To avoid missing out
    on a chance for super-star earnings, lawyers are forced to target initial over-placement, relative to a setting with full information.

              <br> 
		    <p align="justify">   When non-cartel firms adjust their pricing to the supra-competitive level sustained by a cartel, purchasers from non-cartel firms might suffer "umbrella" damages. This is in particular the case for contracts awarded via first-price procurement auctions. This paper examines the bidding behavior of non-cartel firms bidding against the Texas school milk cartel between 1980 and 1992. Evidence is found that the largest non-cartel firm bid significantly higher when facing the cartel. Structural estimation of damages and inefficiencies due to the cartel agreement reveals that per contract: (1) damages from non-cartel firms overbidding are at least 47% of damages caused by the cartel, (2) when the outcome of the auction is inefficient, damages due to misallocation amount to 64% of cartel damages. Finally, inefficiencies raise the winner's cost by 3.7%. These results shed light on the potential importance of umbrella damages from a civil liability perspective. <p>

              <strong>Overconfidence and Preemptive Investment</strong> <i>[2nd year paper]</i>
              <br> 
		    <p align="justify"> Overconfidence is a widely documented personality trait among top managers, with significant effects on corporate decision-making. This paper investigates its effect on the timing of investment by integrating a real options model of investment into a competitive framework with first-mover advantages. The game reflects situations in which competitors have to time technology adoption or new market entry. I find that the overconfident manager always preempts her rational competitor by commiting to follow shortly after being preempted, reducing her rival's incentive to preempt. Under mild levels of overconfidence, firm value increases (relative to the symmetric rational case), but too much overconfidence can be detrimental as the manager erodes the value of waiting. <p>
