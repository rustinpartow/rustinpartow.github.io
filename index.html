        <h5>About me</h5>
       <p> I am an applied micro-economist primarily interested in labor market dynamics and especially the process by which the market aggregates
	       information about workers. I am on the market in 2019/20.<p>

		<p align="justify">
			Certain occupations feature a wide spectrum of talent. A moderately efficient market should ensure that the top (most talented) workers be eventually allocated the top (most challenging) work. By what process is this long-run outcome achieved? I establish empirical evidence from law showing that workers tend to start at the top firms before cascading down the firm ranks. I do this by analyzing a new worker-firm panel data-set that I created by linking annual Martindale-Hubbell professional directories from 1930-1963 and merging them to de-anonymized US Census micro-data. I then develop a new fully dynamic model of asymmetric employer learning with heterogeneous firms which explains this phenomenon and produces a rich variety of other positive and normative implications. In the model, employers privately learn their workers' talents. This information is then partially leaked through endogenous retention decisions. At the margin, firms with higher standards for retention will leak more of their information. High-type firms become beacons of information, because the difficulty of their work forces them to be picky about who to retain. Young workers over-place, matching with inefficiently high-type firms at relatively low wages, in exchange for an opportunity to prove themselves. The majority of inter-firm mobility is pointed downward. The model predicts that the magnitudes of over-placement and downward mobility are both inversely related to the flow of public information about employee talents. I show evidence that this was indeed the case in the market for US lawyers by exploiting the fact that Martindale-Hubbell furnished public ability ratings that were more precise in some locations than others. Finally, I use my data to structurally estimate the model and perform several counterfactual policy simulations in order to assess the welfare effects of market interventions that change the information structure.

        <strong> Collusive Capacity, </strong> with <a class="hidelink" href="https://sites.google.com/a/g.ucla.edu/daehyunkim/"> Daehyun Kim </a> (Link coming soon!)
		    <p align="justify">
	This paper adds collusive capacity to the classic theory of collusion in dynamic oligopolies, where capacity is usually assumed away or treated as exogenous. Similar to most of the literature, we assume that collusive quantities or prices are enforced by the threat of a grim trigger punishment. However, in our model, firms accumulate just enough capacity to inflict this punishment, and no more--a collusive choice that is also enforced within the game. When firms restrict their capacities in this way, the profits of deviating from a collusive regime are greatly reduced, especially as the number of firms grows large. Our main result is an upper bound for the critical (i.e., maximal) discount factor at which monopoly profits can be achieved via collusion, which, uniformly across all possible numbers of firms, is strictly below 1. The collusive capacity levels chosen in our equilibrium are identical to what would be considered competitive capacity levels, which means that they require minimal coordination and should be thought of as a conservative analysis of how the robustness of collusion changes when one seriously considers capacity constraints. Hence, we conclude that collusion with many firms is far more viable than previously thought, at least in industries with irreversible and public capacity investment.

		        <strong> Retention and Adapative Paysetting in Large Organizations, </strong> with <a class="hidelink" href="https://economics.ucla.edu/person/moshe-buchinsky/"> Moshe Buchinsky  </a> and <a class="hidelink" href="https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/john-defigueiredo">  John deFiguereido </a> (Link coming soon!)
				    <p align="justify">
							In 1990, the US federal government passed the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA). Since passing the act, the government has measured competing local wages for its workforce, and has used these measures to estimate inside-outside pay gaps in each of 32 federal localities. To help recruit and retain workers in high-wage areas, the government pays locality pay supplements to workers that are proportional to the average pay gap. We estimate a structural model of employee quit decisions that allows us to assess the benefits, via added retention, of FEPCA-induced pay increases. Our identification strategy exploits a Bartik-like feature of the FEPCA policy: although the government collected rich micro-level estimate of outside wages, these measures were averaged by locality before determining locality pay. Hence, if two workers faced similar outside and inside wages, but lived in locations where the average workers’ inside-outside pay gaps differ, they would receive different amounts of locality pay. The model is estimated by combining disaggregated wage-gap measures from the BLS with the federal government’s administrative payroll data.

	<strong> The Effects of Certified Public Accountant Exams on the Earnings of Accountants </strong>
	<br>
		<p align = "justify"> Partow (2019) predicts that introducing exogenous sources of public information about workers' talents into the labor market will increase average earnings as well as earnings inequality. To test this hypothesis, I use the phased rollout of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams across different states as a quasi-experimental increase in public information. I compare the within-state earnings distributions of accountants on the basis of whether or not their state had a CPA exam, as well as the informativeness of their state's exam (based on passage rates).

	<strong> Why do Big-Law Firms pay the exact same Starting Salaries?    </strong>
	<br>
	<p align = "justify">
		The largest 100 law firms differ widely along many important margins--profitability, hours, prestige, work-life balance, promotion probabilities, exit options, amenities, pension benefits, pro-bono opportunities, and more. It is therefore puzzling that, for about half a century, these firms have typically offered the exact same wages to first-year associates. A popular explanation for this phenomenon is that, by appealing to industry norms rather than economic calculations when determining wages, firms can cultivate a greater sense of professionalism and dignity. However, this explanation seems inconsistent with episodic industry-wide increases in first-year pay, which clearly are economic. In this project, I use data on the top 100 law firms to evaluate two competing economic explanations for matching on first-year pay. The first explanation posits that firms are engaged in tacit collusion on wages, supported by the threat of a "salary war," resulting in below-competitive wages. The second explanation posits that firms are engaged in a game of incomplete information, where they use first-year wages in order to credibly signal their financial health to prospective employees, generating wages that are higher than the competitive full-information setting.

<strong> Implicit Income Variability Penalties from Progressive Taxation</strong>
<br>
<p align = "justify">
Progressive income taxation creates a more equitable distribution of resources at the possible expense of distorting the incentives to work. However, progressive income taxation also penalizes the choice of careers with high state-dependent or intertemporal variability in earnings. This under-appreciated distortion is a simple consequence of Jensen's inequality: any tax schedule where after-tax earnings are concave in pre-tax earnings will penalize pre-tax income variability. In this project, I combine cross-country data on income taxation and longitudinal earnings in order to simulate after-tax earnings and quantify the occupations for which the income variability penalty has typically been largest. To check whether the income variability penalty actually distorts economic decisions, I perform a cross-country case study of farmers, who have occasionally received special "income-averaging" tax provisions designed to mitigate the income variability penalty. I test whether the introduction or repeal of these provisions was associated with greater or reduced preference for planting risky crops.
