        <h5>About me</h5> 
       <p> I am an applied micro-economist primarily interested in labor market dynamics and especially the process by which the market aggregates
	       information about workers. I am on the market in 2019/20.<p>

		<p align="justify"> Certain occupations feature a wide spectrum of talent, in which case we expect the most talented workers to eventually be assigned to the top firms. How is this long-run assignment achieved? This paper combines empirics with theory to predict that, in labor markets with asymmetric employer learning, young workers will tend to cluster at top firms, and then cascade down the firm hierarchy towards long-run efficient matches. I establish these facts by linking annual Martindale-Hubbell professional directories from 1930-1963, creating a worker-firm panel data-set, and merging them to de-anonymized US Census micro-data. I then develop a new fully dynamic model of asymmetric employer learning with heterogeneous firms that explains these facts. Employers privately learn their workers' talents, and then this information is partially leaked through endogenous retention decisions. However, these decisions are only ex-post informative when there was an ex-ante high probability of the worker being fired. In search of the opportunity to develop credentials, young workers will therefore tend to over-place, accepting jobs at inefficiently high-type firms whose cannot afford to retain them unless they truly are talented. The model generates several testable implications that are confirmed by the data--most importantly, that the rate at which workers move down the firm hierarchy is inversely related to the amount of exogenous public learning. Finally, because the model predicts that asymmetric learning creates inefficiencies, I structurally estimate the model and perform several counterfactual policy simulations in order to assess the welfare effects of introducing new public information into the market.

              <br> 
		    <p align="justify">   When non-cartel firms adjust their pricing to the supra-competitive level sustained by a cartel, purchasers from non-cartel firms might suffer "umbrella" damages. This is in particular the case for contracts awarded via first-price procurement auctions. This paper examines the bidding behavior of non-cartel firms bidding against the Texas school milk cartel between 1980 and 1992. Evidence is found that the largest non-cartel firm bid significantly higher when facing the cartel. Structural estimation of damages and inefficiencies due to the cartel agreement reveals that per contract: (1) damages from non-cartel firms overbidding are at least 47% of damages caused by the cartel, (2) when the outcome of the auction is inefficient, damages due to misallocation amount to 64% of cartel damages. Finally, inefficiencies raise the winner's cost by 3.7%. These results shed light on the potential importance of umbrella damages from a civil liability perspective. <p>

	<strong> Public Information in the Labor Market: the Effects of the CPA Exam on the Earnings of Accountants </strong>
	<br>
		<p align = "justify"> Partow (2019) predicts that injecting a supplemental source of public information about workers' talents into the labor market will increase average earnings as well as earnings inequality. To test this hypothesis, I use the phased rollout of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exams across different states as a quasi-experimental increase in public information. I compare the within-state earnings distributions of accountants on the basis of whether or not their state had a CPA exam, as well as the informativeness of their state's exam (based on passage rates).
